# One Man, One Subscription: Mister Rogers and Conditional Rendering

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## User Story

This project talks about the biography of Fred Rogers, known to all as Mister Rogers, as he transformed the entire country to be more kind and peaceful. You can see this through the article taken from the Heinz History Museum website (https://www.heinzhistorycenter.org/blog/western-pennsylvania-history-wont-you-be-my-neighbor-mister-rogers/). More on that in the credits.

Putting Mister Rogers aside, however, the REAL aspect of the project lies in Conditional Rendering in React. This is showcased in the "App.js" file. If the user is subscribed, then the article (previously mentioned) is showcased. If not, then they see the message "Subscribe to unlock the latest article from the Neighborhood".

### Deployment
